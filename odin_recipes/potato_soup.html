<img src="omelet.webp" alt="">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</p>

 <p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</p>
    
<p>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. 
    Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</p>
    
  <p>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</p>
